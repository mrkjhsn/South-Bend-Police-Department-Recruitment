# South-Bend-Police-Department-Recruitment

While watching the first Democratic primary debate the Mayor of South Bend Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, was confronted with the underrepresentation of black police officers in the South Bend Police Department.  While listening to an Axe Files [podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/turner-podcast-network/the-axe-files-presented-by-the-university-of-chicago-institute/e/49418315?autoplay=true), Mayor Pete goes into more detail about the struggle to hire a higher percent of black police officers, as well as referencing a [dataset](https://data-southbend.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sbpd-recruitment-data) published on the South Bend Data Portal shining a light on the recruitment process and painting a fuller picture of where recruits dropped off in the hiring process.  I'm interested in exploring this dataset to prove out Mayor Pete's efforts to develop a more diverse police department.
