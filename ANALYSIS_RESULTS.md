#### During his tenure as Mayor of South Bend IN, Pete Buttigieg has made an effort to increase racial diversity in the South Bend Police Department.  During the first Democratic Presidential debate(June 27, 2019) of the 2020 election Mayor Pete [admitted](https://youtu.be/ibV7dtDK6rQ) that he has failed at this effort.

Currently, South Bend IN is approximately [28%](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/south-bend-in/) black.  However black officers only make up about [5%](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/publicsafety/south-bend-police-see-successful-year-of-recruiting-but-still/article_cc8a29aa-9a31-5bf7-887e-5cfc9a1a2465.html) of it's police force.

The city of South Bend IN publishes a [dataset](https://data-southbend.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sbpd-recruitment-data) detailing the number of recruits that have applied, including race of the applicants and which stages of the recruiting process have contributed to applicants dropping out of the recruiting process.  The dataset includes recruiting cycles from 2017 - 2019.

I wanted to look into the data to better understand the efforts that have been made in this area.  Does it appear as if the South Bend Police Department has made a good faith effort to promote diversity?  Additionally, promoting diversity within police forces across the nation is a problem that many cities struggle with.  Does the recruiting data from South Bend IN shed any light on recruiting practices that other cities might learn from?

What is the ethnicity of applicants to the police force?  (Note:  its unclear to me why such a large quantity of applicants don't provide ethnicity.  Options that applicants could have been provided on the application include "Two or More Races (Not Hispanic or Latino)" and "Prefer not to answer".) It's possible that these may be applicants that are half serious about the application process.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Within the top three races, how has the count changed over time?  Based on the chart below, the percent of applicants from the top three races has tracked very constant.  By a few percentage points slightly more black applicants have applied each year since 2017.  Between 2018 and 2019, a slightly smaller percent of white candidates applied.  Hispanic applicants have remained roughly the same.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What method are applicants using to apply?  Based on the chart below it seems the South Bend Police Department is being proactive at targeting younger candidates by allowing the Police Officer application to be easily accessed through mobile phones.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Within the top six methods of advertisement, how has the count of applicants from each method changed over time?  Based on the chart below it seems the South Bend Police Department is making heavy use of targeted advertisement through online forums, channels that can easily focus on specific minorities(Indeed, LinkedIn, ect.).

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How has the number of applicants from each race changed based on methods of advertisement over time?  Based on the chart below, it doesn't appear that any of the races is more affected by a specific channel of advertisement.  Between 2017 - 2019 all races saw an increase in the count of applicants applying through "Internet/Job Boards".  This does not seem to confirm targed advertisment to minorities.  The South Bend Police Department appears to by using the same strategy each year, which doesn't speak to a proactive strategy towards recruiting minorities.

<br/>
<br/>
What was the last status of applicants in the hiring process for all races?  How has this changed over time?  Based on the chart below, the largest obstacle to all races is incomplete applications.  This may speak to a lack of seriousness in the application process.  The second largest obstacle is not showing up for the physical fitness test.  Between 2018 - 2019 White applicants saw an increase in candidates who make it through the first two obstacles, then withdrew from the processs.  On the other hand, since 2017, Black applicants saw an increase in incomplete applications along with a simultaneous decrease in not showing up for the physical fitness test.  The percent who withrew or were disqualified has slightly dropped for Blacks.  This seems to indicate that over the past three years(although more Black candidates are applying), Blacks are no better than were they were at getting through the first two steps of the application process. (Note: for 2017, no Hispanic applicants are recorded to have dropped out of the application process because of "Reviwed Disqualified(Police)" or "Withdrew".)

#### Summary: Although some efforts have been made to attract minorities(as evidenced by a slight increase in the percent of black applicants), there is little change in the main two forces that prevent applicants from moving beyond the first two steps of the recruitment process.

1. The city could shorten the application to make it easier to complete.  They could perform analysis to determine which areas of the application applicants don't get past.  Could those things be left off and addressed at a later time, say when they show up for the physical?

1. It's possible recruits don't show up to the physical because they are unsure of the physical fitness exercises they will be tested on.  The city has combated this to some extent by providing a youtube video on their recruiting website detailing the expectations.  But the city could provide physical fitness classes to applicants months in advance of the fitness test.  This might give candidates the confidence to show up to the physical test feeling more confident that they will pass.

1. The Police Department could increase non-enformcent interactions with the community, such as school visits(grade school, middle school, highschool) or community engagements that work against stereotypes of police brutality.  If data about these interactions was kept for 20 years, it would be interesting to analyze the influence on the recruitment data.
